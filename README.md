Experiment setup for the `k`-GroDel paper.

This Repository contains the [simexpal](https://github.com/hu-macsy/simexpal/) setup. To run the experiments, first build the python module of the networkit fork at https://github.com/bernlu/networkit-robustness/tree/feature/robustness-module-core.
Then use simexpal to run the experiments.
